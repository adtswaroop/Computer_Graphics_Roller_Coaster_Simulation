This project uses Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL core profile shader-based lighting and texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation. 
Two shaders implementation: one for texture mapping (to render the ground), and one for Phong shading (to render the roller coaster rail). 
The simulation runs in a first-person view, allowing the user to "ride" the coaster in an immersive environment.


*Core Features*
- Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track
- Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots
- Render a T-shaped rail cross section
- Render a Double Rail
- Draw additional scene elements: texture-mapped wooden crossbars - I mapped a metallic image instead of wooden bars.
- Render a skybox
